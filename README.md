**TodoList**
---
ToDo List is a API Rest made to practice Spring Boots concepts, arquiteture, new approaches, another frameworks and libs that I didn't know yet, etc. I used this project for study, but If you want use this for your own project: **feel free!**

In this project I used:
+ Spring Boot;
+ Spring Web;
+ Spring JPA;
+ Dev Tool;
+ Spring Security;
+ JWT.

The arquiteture is a simple MVC, but I used this same arquiteture for the Spring Security part of application. So, you will see packages like *"com.todo.secutiry.controller"*.

The concept of this project is simple: users have notes (stickynote). These notes have a date to be finished and they have a user who is the owner. Only user's friends can create news sticky notes, and, surely, the its user.
